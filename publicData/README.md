# NZ GREEN Grid Household Electricity Demand Study: Data R Package
[NZ GREEN Grid](https://www.otago.ac.nz/centre-sustainability/research/energy/otago050285.html) data includes:

 * 1 minute electricity power (W) data for c 40 households in NZ monitored from early 2014 using [gridSpy](https://gridspy.com/) monitors on each power circuit (and the incoming power)
 * Occupant time-use diaries (focused on energy use)
 * Dwelling & appliance surveys

## Data

This folder contains additional data used in the data processing:

 * lists of circuits to sum to get the total power demand for each household
 * short and long household survey question labels. The survey is identical to that used in https://ourarchive.otago.ac.nz/handle/10523/5634. The pdf of the survey is also [available](../docs/EC2HouseholdSurveyAsUsedInGG.pdf) and should be read alongside the labels.
 
 * NZ DST break dates

It does _not_ (and never will) contain the project research data.
