The NZ GREEN Grid project recruited a sample of c 25 households in each of two regions of New Zealand. The first sample was recruited in early 2014 and the second in early 2015. Research data includes:

 * 1 minute electricity power (W) data was collected for each dwelling circuit using [gridSpy](https://gridspy.com/) monitors on each power circuit (and the incoming power). The power values represent mean(W) over the minute preceeding the observation timestamp.
 * Occupant time-use diaries (focused on energy use)
 * Dwelling & appliance surveys
 
We are working towards releasing 'clean' (anonymised) versions of this research data for re-use.
