The [NZ GREEN Grid household electricity demand study](https://cfsotago.github.io/GREENGridData/) recruited a sample of c 25 households in each of two regions of New Zealand [@stephenson_smart_2017]. The first sample was recruited in early 2014 and the second in early 2015. Research data includes:

 * 1 minute electricity power (W) data was collected for each dwelling circuit using [GridSpy](https://gridspy.com/) monitors on each power circuit (and the incoming power). The power values represent mean(W) over the minute preceeding the observation timestamp;
 * Dwelling & appliance surveys;
 * Occupant time-use diaries (focused on energy use).
 
 NB: Version 1 of the data package does not include the time-use diaries.
