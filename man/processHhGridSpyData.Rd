\title{Loads and processes a list of GridSpy data files for a given household}
\usage{
processHhGridSpyData(hh, fileList)
}
\arguments{
\item{hh}{the household id}

\item{fileList}{list of files to load (assumed to be all from hh)}
}
\description{
\code{processHhGridSpyData} takes a file list and loads & processes data before returning the data.table for checks & saving. 
    
    What it does:
    
    - Updates the per input file metadata as it loops over each file
    
    - Fixes circuit labels for rf_46
    
    - Concatenates (rbinds) the files into a data.table and converts to long form for easier re-use
    
    - Splits original circuit name by $ into a label (first string) and an id (second string)
    
    - Attempts to create a correct r_dateTime in UTC but with tz set to "Pacific/Auckland"
    
    - Removes duplicates by r_dateTime <-> circuit <-> power caused by data from duplicate files. Note that this will retain the DST induced duplicate dateTimes if the power values are different (see below)
    
    - Removes any cases where power = NA
    
    - Returns the data.table

\details{
Things to note...
   
     The function assumes all data in the fileList is for one household (can only be detected from input file path)
   
     The original data is sometimes stored as UTC (auto-downloads) & sometimes as NZ time (manual downloads). 
   
     If the original data was actually NZ time then we parse it with tz = Pacific/Auckland. It is not clear what will happen at the DST break.
     
     If the original data was actually UTC then we parse it with the default tz = UTC and then set to Pacific/Auckland. Note that this will create 
     duplicate r_dateTimes during the DST break when there is an extra hour and thus two moments of time with the same r_dateTime.
     
     Any true duplicates by r_dateTime <-> circuit <-> power are then removed (see above) to deal with duplicate data files. 
     However this will also remove observations around the DST break which are different moments of time but have the same 
     r_dateTime (as one of them is in the DST break hour) and by chance the same power values in the same circuits. Got that?
     
     Due to uncertainties over the timezones and dateTimes, we recommend that analysis should exclude the days on which DST changes occur.
     
     #YMMV
   
     Loading the resulting saved data from .csv will probably set the tz of r_dateTime to your local time. Be sure to set it to
     correctly using lubridate::with_tz(r_dateTime, tzone = "Pacific/Auckland")
