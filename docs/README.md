# nzGREENGridDataR
Code to process data from the [NZ GREEN Grid](https://www.otago.ac.nz/centre-sustainability/research/energy/otago050285.html) project.

[NZ GREEN Grid](https://www.otago.ac.nz/centre-sustainability/research/energy/otago050285.html) data includes:

 * 1 minute electricity power (W) data for c 40 households in NZ monitored from early 2014 using [gridSpy](https://gridspy.com/) monitors on each power circuit (and the incoming power)
 * Occupant time-use diaries (focused on energy use)
 * Dwelling & appliance surveys

NB: *None* of the data is held in this repo so *none* of the code here will work unless you also have access to the data.
