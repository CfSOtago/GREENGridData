You will need to register for a (free) UK Data Service account before you can download it. Despite appearances, users from outside the UK _can_ register and download the data but you will need to use a specific form to request a UK Data Service user id: https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/myaccount/credentials 

One registered you should be able to log in and download the data.

‘Live’ data documentation is at: https://cfsotago.github.io/GREENGridData/ 

With example code & issues etc at: https://github.com/CfSOtago/GREENGridData/

We would be very interested to know what users do with the data as we are collecting ‘use’ stories to demonstrate the impact of releasing it. If you can subsequently publish it in some way that would be even better!
