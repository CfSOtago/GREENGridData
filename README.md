# nzGREENGridDataR
Code to process data from the [NZ GREEN Grid](https://www.otago.ac.nz/centre-sustainability/research/energy/otago050285.html) project.

# About

The code in this repo does two things:

 * processes the original data to a 'safe' form for archiving and third party re-use (code will only work if you have the original data)
 * produces original data processing reports (code will only work if you have the original data)
 * produces cleaned 'safe' data reports (code will work on the archived 'safe' data)

NB: *None* of the data is held in this repo so *none* of the code here will work unless you also have access to the data. 

# Data Access

A link to the archived 'safe' version of the data will appear here soon. 

Access to the original data which is stored on the University of Otago's High-Capacity Central File Storage [HCS](https://www.otago.ac.nz/its/services/hosting/otago068353.html) is restricted.

# Using the code

## Comments & suggestions:
Please use git [issues](https://github.com/dataknut/nzGREENGridDataR/issues) to make a comment or point out an error. We also use issues to manage our 'to do' list so please check your comment is not already open :-)
 
## Contributing code
Feel free to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository (or a [branch](https://help.github.com/articles/about-branches/) if you are a collaborator with write access to this repo) and contribute your own additions through the normal git [pull request](https://github.com/dataknut/nzGREENGridDataR/pulls) process (ideally R or [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) please!). If you haven't used github before, now is a good time to [learn](https://guides.github.com/) - it works for any codebase, not just R. For R, we recommend using [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com)'s integrated github features.

If you make a substantive addition to any of the exisiting RMarkdown reports please add yourself as an author. Your contributions will, in any case, be [tracked by github](https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/) and so fully visible to the world in perpetuity :-)
