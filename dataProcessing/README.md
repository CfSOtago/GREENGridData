# NZ GREEN Grid Household Electricity Demand Study: Data R Package

## Data processing

Code to process the original raw data from the [NZ GREEN Grid](https://www.otago.ac.nz/centre-sustainability/research/energy/otago050285.html) project to produce the [final clean version](http://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/853334/) held by the UK Data Service. 

NB: 

 * *None* of the original raw data has been released so *none* of the code here will work unless you also have access to the data; 
 * As a result you should not ever need to (or be able to) run this code. It is here so you can see what was done and raise an [issue](https://github.com/CfSOtago/GREENGridData/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AdataIssue) if you think something should be done differently!
