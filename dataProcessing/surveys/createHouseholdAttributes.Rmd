# Introduction

```{r generic sample, child=ggrParams$sampleGeneric}
```
 
The prupose of this report is to: 

 * create a household attribute file that can be linked to the project power monitoring data;
 * describe the household attribute data.

The resulting cleaned data has _no_ identifying information such as names, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers and is therefore safe to share across all partners.

The data contains a unique household id (`linkID`) which can be used to link it to the NZ GREEN Grid time use diaries and dwelling/appliance surveys. With some additional non-disclosure checks it should also be safe to archive all of these linkable datasets for re-use via the UK [reshare](http://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/) service.

# Load data

## Household master dataset
Table \@ref(tab:loadMasterData) shows the number of households in each area. 

```{r loadMasterData}
hhMasterDT <- nzGREENGridDataR::getHouseholdData(ggrParams$gsHHMasterFile) # cleans it as it loads
setkey(hhMasterDT, linkID)
t <- with(hhMasterDT, table(Location, useNA = "always"))
kableExtra::kable(caption = "Sample location (master file)", t)
```

In total we have `r nrow(hhMasterDT)` households in two sample areas.

## Appliance data

Household appliance ownership was recorded during recruitment using a detailed survey. However this data is not readily available for all households at present. Table \@ref(tab:applianceTable) shows the number of households in each area for whom summary appliance data exists. 

```{r loadApplianceData}
hhAppliancesDT <- data.table::as.data.table(readxl::read_xlsx(ggrParams$ApplianceData))
```

```{r applianceTable}
hhAppliancesDT$sample <- NULL # too detailed
setkey(hhAppliancesDT, linkID)
t <- with(hhAppliancesDT[hhMasterDT], table(Location, hasApplianceSummary, useNA = "always"))
kableExtra::kable(caption = "Sample (appliance summary file, NA indicates no data)", t)
```

The appliances recorded in this summary are shown in Table \@ref(tab:applianceNames).

```{r applianceNames}
xcols <- c("linkID", "hasApplianceSummary")
al <- names(hhAppliancesDT[, -..xcols])
kableExtra::kable(caption = "Appliances recorded", al)
```

## Household survey data

The Energy Cultures 2 survey [@ec2Survey2015] was used to collect data on household energy and transport attitudes/behaviours and usages for one of the regional samples only. The long form of the survey was used for some households and the short form for others.

```{r loadEc2Surveys, include=FALSE}
hhEc2ShortDT <- data.table::as.data.table(readr::read_csv(ggrParams$UnisonShortSurveyData))
hhEc2LongDT <- data.table::as.data.table(readr::read_csv(ggrParams$UnisonLongSurveyData))
```

Table \@ref(tab:loadEc2Survey) shows the response rates to these surveys.

```{r loadEc2Survey}

# Final household attribute data description

Table \@ref(tab:loadEc2Survey) reports the final household attribute variables and their internal distributions. The question labels are found in Table \@ref(tab:loadEc2Labels) below.

```{r summariseHhAttributes}
Hmisc::describe(hhAttributesDT)
```


# Household attribute tables

This section reports tables of the key household attributes by sample location. Note that NA usually means not known.

## Number of adults

```{r nAdults}
t <- with(hhAttributesDT, table(nAdults, Location, useNA = "always"))
kableExtra::kable(caption = "Number of adults in household by location", t)
```

## Number of teenagers

```{r nTeens}
t <- with(hhAttributesDT, table(nTeenagers13_18, Location, useNA = "always"))
kableExtra::kable(caption = "Number of teenagers in household by location", t)
```

## Number of children

```{r nChildren}
t <- with(hhAttributesDT, table(nChildren0_12, Location, useNA = "always"))
kableExtra::kable(caption = "Number of children in household by location", t)
```

## Notes

These may have been set for any number of reasons and mean the monitoring data should be used with caution.

```{r outliers}
t <- with(hhAttributesDT, table(notes, Location, useNA = "always"))
kableExtra::kable(caption = "Notes by location", t)
```

# Summary

```{r saveData}
ofile <- paste0(ggrParams$outPath, "ggHouseholdAttributes.csv")
readr::write_csv(hhAttributesDT, ofile)
```

The cleaned data for the `r nrow(hhAttributesDT)` households has been saved as a .csv file to:

 * `r ggrParams$outPath` 

The following table shows the key columns of the household attributes file. The data can be linked to the gridSpy data using `linkID`.

The purpose of the linkID is to enable the flagging of [re-used grid spy units](gridSpy1mProcessingReport.html#41_recoding_re-allocated_grid_spy_units). As an example unit rf_15 was re-used in a different household. We have created `linkID` so that the correct household data (rf_15a or rf_15b) can be linked to the grid spy data (coded rf_15) at the correct date.

Note also that data exists in the grid spy power demand data for whom no household data exists (e.g. rf_01 & rf_02).

```{r data header}
kable(caption = "Household data: key columns", hhAttributesDT[, c("hhID", "linkID", "Location", "nAdults", "r_stopDate", "notes")][order(hhID)])
```

Only a subset of these variables are currently available in the GREEN Grid safe data package. Requests to add further variables should be made via a [github repo issue](https://github.com/dataknut/nzGREENGridDataR/labels/variableRequest).
