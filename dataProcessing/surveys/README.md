# NZ GREEN Grid Data processing code
[NZ GREEN Grid](https://www.otago.ac.nz/centre-sustainability/research/energy/otago050285.html) data includes:

 * 1 minute electricity power (W) data for c 40 households in NZ monitored from early 2014 using [gridSpy](https://gridspy.com/) monitors on each power circuit (and the incoming power)
 * Occupant time-use diaries (focused on energy use)
 * Dwelling & appliance surveys

_None_ of the code here will work unless you also have access to the data. While we have plans to deposit anonymised versions of the data with a suitable data archive (any offers?!), the data is currently held on the University of Otago High Performance Storage filestore and access is controlled by the [NZ GREEN Grid project administrator](mailto:jane.wilcox@otago.ac.nz?subject=Access to GREEN Grid data (via github readme)).

## Dwelling and appliance surveys

To do.
