# NZ GREEN Grid Household Electricity Demand Study: Data R Package

## Household attributes

The code in this folder constructs the available household attribute data collected during the project. To do this it:

 * merges the various survey files;
 * codes responses where possible;
 * saves a 'full' version for use within the GREEN Grid project;
 * saves a 'safe' (anonymised) version for use in final data package preparation.

We keep a log of [issues](https://github.com/CfSOtago/GREENGridData/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AhhAttributes) - if you detect a new problem with the data (or code) please open a new [issue](https://github.com/CfSOtago/GREENGridData/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AhhAttributes).
